        <p>A smart city uses information and communication technology (ICT) to improve operational efficiency, share information with the public and provide a better quality of government service and citizen welfare.</p>

          <h2>Main Goal</h2>
          <p>The main goal of a smart city is to optimise city functions and promote economic growth while also improving the quality of life for citizens by using smart technologies and data analysis. The value lies in how this technology is used rather than simply how much technology is available.<br><br><br></p>

          <h2>How do they work?</h2>
          <p>Smart cities follow four steps to improve the quality of life and enable economic growth through a network of connected IoT devices and other technologies. These steps are as follows:

            <br>1. Collection
            
            <br>2. Analysis
            
            <br>3. Communication 
            
           <br> 4. Action<br><br>
        </div>

          <div class="icon"><img src="img/icons8-repository-50.png" /></div>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The concept of smart cities began as far back as the 1960s and 1970s when the US Community Analysis Bureau began using databases, aerial photography and cluster analysis to collect data, direct resources and issue reports in order to direct services, mitigate against disasters and reduce poverty. This led to the creation of the first generation of smart cities.</p>

          <h2>Why Smart Cities Are Important?</h2>
          <p>54% of the world’s population live in cities and this is expected to rise to 66% by 2050, adding a further 2.5 billion people to the urban population over the next three decades. With this expected population growth there comes a need to manage environmental, social and economic sustainability of resources. </p>

            <h2>Smart Lighting</h2>
            <p> Infrastructure, Smart lighting is one of the most important solutions that will be implemented in citywide infrastructure. While smart lighting sounds trivial at first glance, it’s worth noting that lighting alone consumes a whopping 19% of the world’s total electricity.

            <h2>Solar Panels</h2>
            <p>Buildings, Heating, energy usage, lighting, and ventilation will be managed and optimized by technology. Solar panels will be integrated into building design, replacing traditional materials. Fire detection and extinguishing is tailored to individual rooms.
